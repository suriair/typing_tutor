	para1 = '''We learned to see, at long last. Partway through the millennium, we figured out how to shape and polish glass so as to see far and to see small, and we dug into dead languages of previous millenniums to name our new aids to seeing-telescope, microscope, spectroscope, spectrophotometer, spectroheliograph and, eventually, television. We figured out the art, the geometry and the semantics of perspective. No wonder our superheroes had X-ray vision; so did we. And infrared vision, and ultraviolet vision, and gamma-ray vision and nuclear-magnetic-resonant vision. We extended our sight far beyond the tiny spectrum our unaided eyes could handle, from violet to red. We looked out, and we looked inside. We saw where earth is and what humans are (if not quite who we are). We noticed quasars and we noticed viruses. Surprise! "In all falling rain, carried from gutters into water-butts, animalcules are to be found. in all kinds of water, standing in the open air, animalcules can turn up," noted Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the first man to observe bacteria. We figured out some things about color and space. "To myself," Isaac Newton remarked modestly, "I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me." Then-and perhaps most important of all-we learned to see faster. Our sight expanded into the fourth dimension. It started innocently enough, with mundane items like railroad scheduling charts and weather histograms: new graphical representations of time. "Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record," said a famous fictional character, the Time Traveler of H. G. Wells, explaining the fourth dimension years before mathematicians and physicists had worked out the details. "This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognized?" The hero of "The Time Machine" was a time traveler who used ivory levers and quartz rods. But Wells also invented another kind of time traveler, a Professor Gibberne, hero of a little-known story published at the turn of the century under the title "The New Accelerator." Professor Gibberne is a time traveler on drugs-really preparing no less than the absolute acceleration of life.'''
	para2 = '''The term euthanasia comes from the Greek word 'euthanatos meaning 'good death. It is an act or practice of ending the lite of an individual suffering from a terminal illness or an incurable condition. It is also known as mercy killing' which is an act where the individual who has no chance of survival as he is suffering from painful life, ends his life in a painless manner. lt is a gentle, easy and painless death. It is basically to bring about the death of a terminally ill patient or a disabled. Euthanasia is thus practised so that a person can live as well as die with dignity. There are two types of euthanasia namely, active euthanasia and passive euthanasia. Active euthanasia or positive euthanasia reters to causing intentional death of a human being by direct intervention. It is a direct action performed to end useless life and a meaningless existence. E.g. by giving lethal dose of a drug or by giving a lethal injection. On the other hand, passive euthanasia or negative euthanasia is intentionally causing death by not providing essential, necessary and ordinary care or food and water. It implies to discontinuing, withdrawing or removing artificial life support system. PasSive euthanasia is usually slower and more uncomfortable than active. 5etore moving further, it is important to note that there is a difference between Duicide and 'Euthanasia'. In a suicide, a man voluntarily kills himself by stabbing poisoning or by any other mean. it is an act of intentionally killing oneself due to depression or other reasons. On the other hand, euthanasia is an action of a person to bring to an end the lite or another person.

	para4 = '''Promotion of educational faculties in every country is a most important factor. Illiterate people are just like persons finding their way in the darkness, whereas education enlightens their minds and makes them easy to find their way in this huge fair of humanity. It is unfortunate that we have not concentrated on effective teaching in general and primary education in particular. First of all, it is the primary schools which demand proper attention by providing required infrastructure and sufficient number or competent teachers. We should spend liberally on primary schools in every respect. If students at primary school level possess adequate knowledge, they will surely perform well at high-school level and even at college and university levels. It is strange, in our country officers and political leaders at the healm of affairs regarding education systems, like to give more importance to higher education of university level by establishing more and more universities, whereas plight of primary education is miserable. Proper infrastructure in primary schools especially in rural areas is inadequate. Most of these schools have inadequate teaching staff and these schools are without even black- board and proper sitting arrangements. In most of the village primary schools, even required number of class-rooms are not available and two classes are being conducted in single room. Primary schools are just like nurseries. If plants in nurseries are not healthy, how they can develop after their replantation. Similarly, if students at primary school level come out with poor or adequate knowledge, how can we expect excellence from them at middle and high school levels. It is observed that there is unusual shortage of teachers in almost every region. Schools and colleges are being rapidly opened to please the masses, but these institutions are without building, infrastructure and regular & competent teaching staff, mainly due to non-availability of funds. As a matter of fact, government often seem to have given little priority to education. They usually appoint teachers on reduced emoluments or on contract, adhoc, and temporary grade on voluntary basis. Need of the amour is to provide huge funds for primary education to appoint very good and trained teachers, to provide sufficient infrastructure and provide Sufficient classrooms. Unless primary schools are not ideal and exemplary, education at middle school level, high & high secondary level cannot be approved up to the required standard.'''
